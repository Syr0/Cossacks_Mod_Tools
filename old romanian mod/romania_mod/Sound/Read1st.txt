Alternate Sounds 1.0 for Cossacks demo 1.x   

Back up your cossacks/sound folder first! 
Unzip into cossacks/sound folder. You should know how to do all this anyways, if you don't then
you need professional help..;-)

New explosions, muskets, and "smerts";
plus a raven sound for the woods.

This the sound mod I play with, just a rough test, I am still refining the sounds as I "playtest"
and working on improving the sound quality; it is hard since the game sounds are 8 bit/22000hz/mono 
(reducing hiss and improving ambience)

The mortar/howitzer "whizz" doesn't always sync, but better than silent hits and falling debris
, adds atmosphere.

What a great game! I just got the demo off the Maximum PC mag CD and am enjoying very much!
Feel free to distribute amongst various players/websites..just keep this text in the zip file and mention me!
